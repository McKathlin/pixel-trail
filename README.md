# Pixel Trail
This app has a grid of pixel squares that darken when you hover over them.

It's live on GitHub; try it out here: [Pixel Trail](https://mckathlin.github.io/pixel-trail/)

You can customize the amount of pixels of the grid:
set the Width and Height inputs to your preference and click the Reset Grid button.
Up to 100 x 100 is supported.
